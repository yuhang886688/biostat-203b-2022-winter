### Usage of Git: 10/10

-   Are branches (`main` and `develop`) correctly set up? Is the hw submission put into the `main` branch?

    Yes.
    
-   Are there enough commits (>=5) in develop branch? Are commit messages clear? The commits should span out not clustered the day before deadline. 

    Yes.

### Reproducibility: 10/10

    Yes.
    
-   If necessary, are there clear instructions, either in report or in a separate file, how to reproduce the results?
